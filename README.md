🔧 C Programming Practice Projects
Welcome to my repository of C & C++ programs!
This collection includes fundamental and intermediate-level programs focused on arrays, sorting, searching, matrix operations, and more — perfect for understanding core logic and improving programming skills.

📚 Overview
This repository is a personal archive of my programming journey, mainly developed for practice, learning, and reference.
Each source file (.c / .cpp) has a corresponding executable (.exe) for Windows systems.

📁 Folder Structure
📌 Array Operations
array1.c – Basic array operations

copyarray.c – Copy array elements

revarray.c – Reverse an array

duplicate.c – Detect duplicates

uniqueelements.c – Display unique elements

circulararray.c – Circular array implementation

union.c / unnion.c – Array union operations

🔍 Searching Algorithms
linearsearch.c – Linear Search

🔃 Sorting Algorithms
bubblesort.c – Bubble Sort

insertion.c – Insertion Sort

🧮 Matrix Operations
matrix.c – Matrix manipulation

mul.c – Matrix multiplication

maddd.c – Matrix addition

🔢 Max / Min
maxmin.c – Find maximum and minimum

max.exe, 2ndmax.exe – Find max / second max

➕ Extra Logic Programs
deletion.c – Element deletion

oddeven.c – Odd & even separation

freq.c, freqq.c – Frequency count

extra.c, extraa.c – Misc logic problems

🧪 Test & Miscellaneous
demo.cpp – C++ demo file

hw1.c, tempCodeRunnerFile.c – Scratch/test files

quiz.html – A basic HTML quiz interface

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Open any .c or .cpp file in a C/C++ compiler like:

Code::Blocks

Turbo C++

Dev C++

VS Code (with GCC)

Compile and run the file.

Or just run the .exe files directly on Windows.

💡 Purpose
✅ Strengthen logic building
✅ Practice core programming concepts
✅ Prepare for college exams or coding interviews
✅ Create a foundation for advanced programming topics
